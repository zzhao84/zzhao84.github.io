  	        <p>Hailing from the frozen north of Upstate New York, this small upstart    convinced two humans already dedicated to the royal court of another feline deity to add her into their household. She came to be known as Princess Leia, a cat who is unmatched in her love of eating, grabbing at people with her tiny paws, stepping on prone humans to sniff and meow in their faces, and finding new comfortable places to sleep. Once given a grim prophecy of "Pre-Megacolon" by a local shaman due to her insatiable gluttony, she had to be put under a watchful diet and has now returned to a healthy state.</p>

  	        <p>Though only two years younger than her royal sister, Princess Leia still acts like she is a kitten, even in the prime of both of their lives. Perhaps it is the youthful personality of Leia that earns the ire of her elder sister, or perhaps it is because Leia admires Thor so much and just wants to be her friend, albeit sometimes to an uncomfortably close degree. However, Leia will never give up on trying to win her sister over, even if it earns her a smack on the head or a bite on the rump. Every now and then the sound of Leia screaming as she is wrestled down, beaten, and eventually running away in terror can be heard throughout the castle. Unlike her Star Wars royal-namesake, Princess Leia is definitely not a fighter; she is a lover through and through, even if it is to a fault.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
