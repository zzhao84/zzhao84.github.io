  	        <p> <strong>The Ballad of Thor</strong></p>
  	        <p>In a faraway land once known as the Maryland, a tiny kitten with the spirit of the Norse God of Thunder was locked away in a crude prison known to the local rabble as a "pet store." One day, a pair of humans came upon the kitten and were instantly enchanted by her fabled cat-magic. Mere mortals were no match for her charm, her extremely attractive furry ear-tuffs, and her uncanny ability to curl up on laps. Over the years she slept, ate, groomed and grew, eventually taking her rightful place as Princess Thor, first of her name, basker of the fireplace, most dominant of the household.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  	        <p> <strong>The Ruler vs. The Heir</strong></p>
  	        <p>When Princess Leia first joined the household, Princess Thor was inviting and more often than not loving toward her adopted little sister. Over time, however, she noticed a sneaky trait in the other cat. Leia would take any opportunity to eat more than her fair share; she never stole Thor's food outright, but waited until the elder was done to lick at scraps, or ate the other's portion if Thor was late to a magically-dispensed meal from the conjurer's contraption known as the "Automatic Pet Feeder." This and other small annoyances would earn the smaller cat Thor's eternal wrath, leading to frequent hissing and the occasional royal beating.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
